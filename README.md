Team 4 Project 2 - Workout App

Team Members: Shahrooz, Patrick, Matt K, Elaine

An app that creates a custom workout based on user preferences.

An emerging market trend is home workouts (Pelton, P90X, etc) where you can work out in your own home, but those are not customizable, that is where our app comes in! It allows the user to focus on a certain area (ie: upper body, legs) and adjust the workout based on their fitness.

Log-In- User logs in to be able to save workouts

Home Page- Pre-set workouts to choose from or ability to customize your own workout based on workout type and target area.

Workout page- Lists the workout with exercise, sets/reps, thumbnail image of exercise. Each image is able to be deleted or checked off if completed.
